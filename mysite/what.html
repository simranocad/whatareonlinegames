<h1>WHAT ARE CIRCLE GAMES ?</h1>
<p>Circle Games are an exciting selection of puzzle, response, and collaborative Interactive games that can be played online for free. These games are ideal for individuals who think in a circular rather than predictable sequence. The games feature catching circles, moving in circular patterns to achieve goals, or expanding as a circle.</p>
<br>

<p1>Simply roll around as a circle on the two games created, crushing your opponents by using keys and collecting larger circles to beat the score. Browse through my cool collection of Circle Games that I designed, pick your personal best, and have a great time. When you're done, just start over since a circle has no endpoint. Isn't that amazing? Have fun with my two fantastic games, Circle Rush and Crazy Circles.</p1>

<h6>HELLO, I'M CRAZY CIRCLE 1</h6>



<!-- <h7>ABOUT MY GAME</h7> -->


<p4>Hi, <br>I'm a game made out of circles, born in 2023 
    and I'm interested in destroying the enemy.

    To create this game, I used 100% HTML, JS & CSS. 
    I made this game keeping in mind simple elements and shapes,
<br>
Through this I learnt basics of Java Script and html and even 
learnt how to add sound effects for capturing enemy circles.
 You will further learn how to make this game and also how to 
 play the game using just a mouse!</p4>
