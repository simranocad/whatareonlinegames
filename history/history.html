      <h2>History of Online Games</h2>
      <br>
      <p>Online games have been around since the early days of the internet, but they really took off in the late 1990s and early 2000s with the advent of high-speed internet and more powerful computers. Some of the earliest online games were simple text-based games like MUDs (multi-user dungeons), which allowed players to explore virtual worlds and interact with other players in real-time. As technology advanced, online games became more sophisticated, with the introduction of 3D graphics, online multiplayer games, and massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs).<br>
         <br>
         Early in the twenty-first century, social media exploded in popularity, and web designers raced to take advantage of the possibilities that Facebook and Myspace offered. To develop a Web-based gaming experience similar to earlier home consoles, they used animation tools like Flash. These games gained widespread appeal because to their straightforward gameplay and cartoon-like visuals, and many of them provided rewards for players who brought in new players. The most popular "Facebook games," such as Mafia Wars (2008), Farmville (2009), and The Sims Social (2011) from EA, maximised profits by rewarding users for engaging with advertising partners and trading in-game cash. Electronic gaming started to spread in the 1970s and 1980s as computer networks grew gradually. People used to talk and play games on bulletin-board systems (BBSs), and some firms even developed play-by-email games, but it wasn't until the early 1980s with the introduction of internet services that electronic gaming truly took off. MegaWars, a Star Trek-inspired game, was originally played in multiplayer on mainframe terminals at the University of Texas before being released by CompuServ in 1982. <br>
         <br>
         While playing this game opened up new realms, as Jimmy Maher notes in his excellent history of these early games, it also frequently resulted in high connection costs because players were charged by the minute.Online gaming evolved fast as processing capabilities and network connections improved significantly. Consoles joined PCs in the online world in the 1990s, but it wasn't until Xbox Live in 2002 that online play became genuinely essential to the console player experience, thanks to the explosion (pun intended) in popularity of war titles like Unreal Championship and MechAssault. Meanwhile, new social networks like Facebook created games like Farmville and Words with Friends, which drew individuals into the game who would never have considered themselves gamers. With the release of the iPhone in 2009, smart phones placed hundreds of thousands of networked games in the pockets of billions of people all over the world, allowing them to play against one another. We can now play with practically anyone on the world at any time, from anywhere.It's a long way from the days of postal or telegraph chess. like a consequence, even when we are alone, like during the pandemic's quarantines and social isolation a few years back, we will still play together. That's excellent for us because it improves our mental and emotional health, especially when we can play with pals we can't see in person. If you've ever read Laura Ingalls Wilder's The Long Winter, a famous tale of months of near loneliness on the snowbound prairie, you might recall Ma Ingalls promising the girls "entertainment." </p>
